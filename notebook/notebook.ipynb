Her professional journey is \\nmarked by a strong background in handling diverse and end -to-end projects, ranging from \\ndata analysis to the implementation of advanced generative AI technologies. Mazi is \\ndedicated to building innovative solutions that automate repetitive tasks and enhance user \\nexperiences through cutting -edge data analytics.  \\nMetrodata , Jakarta,  Indonesia, Apr 2024 - Present  \\nMetrodata is an information IT company in Indonesia. As a Data Scientist at a consultant \\ncompany, Mazi has  been working with several leading companies and industries in Indonesia \\nto build automation products involving Machine  Learning and Generative AI.  \\nNotable Projects  \\n1. HR Chatbot Development  - Led the development of a  internal company policies \\nchatbot  in an Indonesia leading food and beverage company using Microsoft Azure \\nOpen AI to automate HR daily tasks and improve employe es awareness in company \\npolicies . This project involved integrating Gen AI models and RAG (Retrieval \\nAugmented Generation) to answer employee queries about company policies, \\nresulting in a 30% reduction in HR response time.  \\n2. Regulation Analysis Tool  - Devel oped a Generative AI tool for a finance industry \\ncompany to summarize and analyse  new regulations  from OJK, Bank Indonesia, and \\nMinistry of Finance.  Improving analysis speed by 70% and enhancing the efficiency \\nof the GRC team.  \\nTools  \\n• Azure AI Services , including Azure Open AI, Azure ML, Azure AI Search, Azure Document \\nIntelligence, and Azure Speech  \\n• Python for Data Analysis and Data Scientist , e.g. pandas, sk -learn, and tensorflow.  \\n• Python libraries for deployment , e.g. Flask, Streamlit.  \\nVidio , Nov 2020 – Apr 2024  \\nVidio is a leading stream ing service  company  in Indonesia. I mainly focused on the \\nrecommendation system, though I also developed churn prediction , content performance prediction \\nand keyword extraction using Generative AI . \\nNotable Projects  \\n1. Implemented a recommendation model collaborative filtering using the cosine similarity \\nalgorithm. Achieved  a remarkable 0.2 Recall@20 and 10%+ click -through rate (CTR), \\nsurpassing in -house model -based  recommendation systems.  \\n2. Collaborated with Mark eting Team predicting persuadable non -subscribers to subscribe. \\nPredictive  modeling is built using Tensorflow Neural Networks and achieved an 87% AUC \\nscore, resulting in a 20%  conversion rate among targeted users.  ',\n",
       "       \"3. Worked closely with a consultant to build a heavy ranker model utilizing multi input neural \\nnetworks,  resulting in CTR increase in implemented sections.  \\n4. Utilizing semi -supervised learning and GPT -4 model to extract micro genres from movies \\nsynopsis  description for a better hybrid recommendation sy stem. This method speeds the \\ntagging process time by  more than 80%.  \\n5. Engineered ETL pipelines for cleaning unpublished films in existing tables, resulting in a 90% \\nreduction in API  errors. Improved data quality and streamlined processing workflows.  \\n6. Transitioned from Scala Spark to PySpark for ETL pipelines, improving code accessibility. This \\nshift enhances collaboration with data analysts, fostering seamless code development and \\nunderstanding.  \\n7. Automated weekly subscription reports using Tableau, reduc ing report creation time by \\n50%.  \\n8. Conducted in -depth analysis of churned subscribers and user behavior, reducing churn rate \\nby 10%.  \\n9. Applied neural network time series analysis to predict monthly subscription trends, \\nfacilitating effective  planning for manag ement and teams.  \\nTools  \\n• Python for Data Analysis and Data Scientist, e.g. pandas, sk -learn, and tensorflow.  \\n• Deployment Tools, Flask, Google Cloud Platform , Git, Jenkins  \\n• Data Engineering Tools, PySpark, airflow  \\n• Visualization Tools, Redash, Tableau, Metadata  \\n \\nTeaching and Mentoring  \\nIn addition to her professional experience, Mazi has a strong passion for teaching and \\nmentoring.  \\nAI and IoT Mentor  \\nSkilvul for Samsung Innovation Campus Batch 5  \\nMar 2024 - Jul 2024  \\nSamsung Innovation Campus is a bootcamp and competition by Samsung Indonesia \\nfor high school and university students to compete in AI and IoT projects that solve \\ndaily problems. Mazi's commitment to education continued with her role as an IoT and AI \\nmentor  for Samsung Innovation Campus under Skilvul, an education company. In this role, \\nshe mentored 24 students, helping them understand complex materials and providing \\nintensive guidance to foster their innovative product development.  Her approach in teaching \\nis approaching students i n smaller groups or one -on-one settings, students were more \\ncomfortable asking questions, significantly enhancing their learning experience.  \\nThere are two stages of bootcamp  \\n• The first stage  Mentoring 1000+ high school and university  students online about \\nfundamental of AI and IoT concepts.  \",\n",
